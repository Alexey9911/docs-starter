CryptoGuard is built to minimize data collection while still delivering strong protection. This page summarizes how privacy is handled inside the product.

## Privacy principles

- You own your data and control what is shared.
- We collect the minimum data needed to provide security.
- We provide transparency so you can verify what is used.

## What we do not access

- Private keys or seed phrases
- Wallet signing secrets
- Browser history outside the active page being analyzed

## What we may process

- The active URL and page signals needed to detect threats
- Public blockchain data required for contract and address analysis
- Optional telemetry that you can disable in settings

## How data is handled

- Local checks run in the extension whenever possible
- Cloud analysis is used only for threat intelligence and model inference
- Data is scoped to the security action you requested

## Telemetry controls

Telemetry is optional and off by default for sensitive workflows. If you enable it, you can still limit event types and revoke consent at any time.

## Data lifecycle

CryptoGuard stores data only as long as it is needed for security analysis and support. You can request deletion of associated metadata through support.

## Your control

- Turn telemetry on or off
- Clear local cache and allowlists
- Review the full policy in [Privacy policy](/about/privacy-policy)
