CryptoGuard uses a layered detection system that combines rules, learned models, and simulations. The goal is to surface risks early without relying on a single signal.

## Detection principles

- Prefer local checks for speed and privacy.
- Require multiple signals for high-impact blocks.
- Explain every warning in human terms.

## Signals we analyze

- URL structure and redirect behavior
- Page scripts and wallet connection flows
- Smart contract bytecode and function selectors
- Transaction intent, value movement, and approvals
- Reputation data for addresses and domains

## Detection flow

1. Fast checks run locally for immediate warnings.
2. A deeper analysis runs when higher risk is suspected.
3. A final decision is made from combined signals.

## Response actions

- Warn when signals are suspicious but unconfirmed
- Block when evidence is high confidence
- Explain why a risk was surfaced so you can decide

## Model safety

Models are used for classification, but every decision is constrained by rule-based safeguards so false positives do not automatically block actions.

## Confidence levels

CryptoGuard assigns a confidence score alongside risk. A medium confidence warning suggests you should review details, while a high confidence block indicates multiple independent signals confirm malicious behavior.

## Handling false positives

If you believe a warning is incorrect, report it directly from the extension. This feeds back into signal validation and helps the system improve without reducing baseline protection.
