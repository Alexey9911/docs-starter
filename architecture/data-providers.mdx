ChainGuard integrates with external data sources for token and address risk checks. This page lists the supported chains for these checks.

## Signal categories

- **Token security**: Honeypot risk, taxes, mintability, blacklist patterns.
- **Address security**: Known attacker tags, mixer exposure, and risky counterparties.
- **Contract verification**: Source verification status and bytecode matches.

## Supported chains

- **Ethereum (1)**: Token security supported. Address security supported.
- **BNB Chain (56)**: Token security supported. Address security supported.
- **Polygon (137)**: Token security supported. Address security supported.
- **Arbitrum (42161)**: Token security supported. Address security supported.
- **Optimism (10)**: Token security supported. Address security supported.
- **Avalanche (43114)**: Token security supported. Address security supported.
- **Fantom (250)**: Token security supported. Address security not supported.
- **Cronos (25)**: Token security supported. Address security not supported.

## Update cadence

Most signals refresh within minutes. For time-sensitive threats, ChainGuard prioritizes real-time feeds and applies short cache windows so you see changes quickly.

## Provider validation

Signals are never trusted in isolation. ChainGuard cross-checks multiple sources, down-weights stale feeds, and applies internal heuristics before a decision is surfaced.

## Privacy considerations

Only the minimum metadata needed for enrichment is sent to providers. You should not expect any provider to receive wallet secrets or full browsing history.
