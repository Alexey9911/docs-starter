One of the core principles of software development is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). This principle applies to documentation too. When you see the same paragraph, warning, or example appear in multiple pages, you should convert it into a snippet so you can update it once.

Snippets help you keep language consistent, reduce mistakes, and speed up edits across the docs. Use them for shared onboarding steps, repeated API caveats, or compliance notes that must stay aligned.

Common use cases:

- A standardized security warning shown on multiple pages.
- A reusable API error handling example.
- A shared glossary explanation or UI instruction.

When you create a snippet, keep it focused on a single purpose. You want the snippet to be easy to read on its own, while still fitting naturally wherever you embed it.
