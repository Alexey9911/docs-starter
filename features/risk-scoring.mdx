Risk scoring combines multiple security signals into a single, easy-to-read outcome. It is designed to help you decide quickly without hiding the details.

## Score ranges

Use the score as a quick summary, then open the details when the score is elevated.

- **0 to 24**: Low risk. Typical for verified protocols and long-lived addresses.
- **25 to 49**: Moderate risk. Review the explanation before you proceed.
- **50 to 74**: High risk. Expect warnings and extra confirmations.
- **75 to 100**: Critical. ChainGuard may block the action.

## What influences the score

- Contract permissions and upgrade patterns
- Transaction intent and token approval scope
- Address reputation and interaction history
- URL and domain risk signals

## How to use it

- Treat the score as a summary, not a replacement for review
- Open the detailed explanation when something looks off
- Use allowlists for trusted protocols you use frequently

## Transparency

ChainGuard shows which signals contributed to the result so you can make your own decision.

## Tuning and thresholds

You can adjust alert thresholds in **Settings** to match your risk tolerance. Teams typically set lower thresholds for treasury wallets and higher thresholds for test environments.
