ChainGuard analyzes contracts and injected scripts for behaviors that indicate malware, honeypots, or unsafe permissions.

## What counts as malware

In Web3, malware is not just a file on your device. It can be a contract that traps funds, a script that changes your transaction destination, or a fake UI that tricks you into unlimited approvals. ChainGuard treats these behaviors as malware because they lead to loss or control of assets.

## Detection focus

- Contract bytecode patterns associated with traps or ownership abuse
- Token approval flows that exceed normal behavior
- Script injection attempts that modify wallet actions

## Analysis flow

1. Decode and classify contract calls.
2. Evaluate permissions and potential value movement.
3. Compare to known malicious behavior signatures.

## Your outcome

- A clear warning before you interact
- An explanation of the specific risk
- Guidance to proceed or cancel

## Static and dynamic checks

Static checks look at bytecode and signatures without executing the contract. Dynamic checks simulate the transaction in a controlled environment to observe side effects like fund drains or hidden fees. You get a combined decision that favors safety when results are uncertain.

## What you can do when alerted

- Stop the interaction and verify the contract address.
- Compare the UI to the official project site.
- Use the transaction simulation view to see exact fund movement.
