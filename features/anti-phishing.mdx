ChainGuard checks links and wallet connection flows to reduce phishing risk. The focus is on fast, conservative decisions with clear context.

## Why this matters

Phishing attacks evolve quickly and often look like legitimate dApps. You need fast, local checks that do not rely on a single database or domain list. ChainGuard combines heuristics, reputation data, and page behavior to reduce false negatives.

## What is analyzed

- URL structure, redirects, and lookalike patterns
- SSL and certificate validity for active domains
- Page scripts that request wallet actions
- Visual patterns that mimic known dApps

## Detection pipeline

1. Normalize the URL and resolve redirects.
2. Compare domain signals against known brand patterns.
3. Analyze wallet connection flows and injected scripts.
4. Evaluate risk based on combined signals and confidence.

## What you see

- A warning when signals are suspicious
- A block screen when risk is confirmed
- A short explanation of the signals detected

## What you control

- Allowlist trusted domains
- Report false positives
- Disable warnings per site if needed

## Reduce false positives

You can reduce noise by keeping your allowlist tight and reviewing alerts before you dismiss them. When you report a false positive, include any context about the site so the team can validate the domain faster.

## Recommended actions

- Verify the domain name before connecting your wallet.
- Check for unusual redirect chains or unexpected popups.
- If a site is blocked, navigate away and search for the official URL.
